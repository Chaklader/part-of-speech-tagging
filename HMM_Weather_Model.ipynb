    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ specifies a Hidden Markov Model in terms of an emission probability distribution $A$ and a state transition probability distribution $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core HMM Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden Markov Models operate on two fundamental probability distributions that capture different aspects of sequential behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emission Probabilities (A)**: These quantify the likelihood of observing specific evidence given each possible hidden state. In our weather example, this represents how likely the director is to carry an umbrella on rainy versus sunny days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transition Probabilities (B)**: These capture how the hidden states evolve over time by specifying the probability of moving from one state to another between consecutive time steps. For weather, this models how likely rain is to follow sunshine, or sunshine to follow rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial State Distribution**: This optional third component specifies the probability of starting in each possible hidden state, representing our prior beliefs about the system's initial condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporal Structure and Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "At each discrete time step $t$, the model involves two key variables:\n",
    "- $X_t$: The hidden state (unobservable weather condition)\n",
    "- $Y_t$: The observable evidence (umbrella presence)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concrete Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a specific week where you observe the following umbrella pattern: $Y = [\\text{yes}, \\text{no}, \\text{yes}, \\text{no}, \\text{yes}]$ from Monday through Friday, while the actual weather conditions are $X = [\\text{Rainy}, \\text{Sunny}, \\text{Sunny}, \\text{Sunny}, \\text{Rainy}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Wednesday specifically:\n",
    "- Time step: $t = \\text{Wednesday}$ \n",
    "- Observation: $Y_{\\text{Wednesday}} = \\text{yes}$ (umbrella present)\n",
    "- Hidden state: $X_{\\text{Wednesday}} = \\text{Sunny}$ (actual weather)\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates an important HMM characteristic: observations don't perfectly correlate with hidden states. The director might carry an umbrella on a sunny day due to weather forecasts, personal preference, or other factors not captured in our simplified model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Modeling Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The HMM framework captures the uncertainty inherent in real-world systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partial Observability**: We cannot directly observe the weather, only indirect evidence through the umbrella.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probabilistic Relationships**: The connection between weather and umbrella use is uncertain rather than deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Dependencies**: Today's weather influences tomorrow's weather, creating sequential patterns the model can learn and exploit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializing an HMM Network with Pomegranate\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pomegranate library supports [two initialization methods](http://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/HiddenMarkovModel.html#initialization). You can either explicitly provide the three distributions, or you can build the network line-by-line. We'll use the line-by-line method for the example network, but you're free to use either method for the part of speech tagger.\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundational understanding prepares you to tackle the more complex part-of-speech tagging problem, where words serve as observations and grammatical categories represent the hidden states.\n",

    "##### Add the Hidden States\n",
    "\n",
    "When constructing an HMM model using the line-by-line approach, you begin with an empty container and systematically add each component. The first step involves defining the hidden states and specifying their emission probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Emission Probabilities: $P(Y_t | X_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Emission probabilities quantify the relationship between hidden states and observable evidence. These probabilities answer the fundamental question: \"Given that the system is in a particular hidden state, what is the likelihood of observing each possible piece of evidence?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In our weather-umbrella scenario, the emission probabilities capture the director's behavioral patterns under different weather conditions. These represent the core observational model that connects unobservable weather states to observable umbrella decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimating Emission Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world HMM applications typically derive emission probabilities through empirical analysis of training data. For our illustrative example, we assume prior knowledge about the director's behavior has been collected, possibly through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical observation logs\n",
    "- Survey data about umbrella-carrying habits\n",
    "- Weather service correlations\n",
    "- Behavioral pattern analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This data-driven approach mirrors what we'll implement for the part-of-speech tagger, where emission probabilities will be estimated from tagged corpus statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conditional Probability Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The emission probability table below represents our assumed behavioral model:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Weather State | $P(\\text{umbrella} = yes)$ | $P(\\text{umbrella} = no)$ |\n",
    "|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| $Sunny$       | 0.10                      | 0.90                     |\n",
    "| $Rainy$       | 0.80                      | 0.20                     |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting the Probability Values\n",
    "\n",
    "These probabilities encode intuitive behavioral expectations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sunny Day Behavior**: When weather is sunny, the director carries an umbrella only 10% of the time. This reflects practical behavior where umbrellas are less necessary on clear days, though some individuals might carry them for sun protection or due to uncertain forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rainy Day Behavior**: During rainy weather, the director carries an umbrella 80% of the time. The 20% probability of no umbrella accounts for scenarios like forgotten umbrellas, short trips, or personal preference variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that each row sums to 1.0, satisfying the fundamental requirement that probability distributions must be complete and mutually exclusive. For any given weather state, the director either carries an umbrella or doesn'tâ€”these are the only possibilities, and their probabilities must sum to unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This probability structure forms the foundation for the HMM's ability to make probabilistic inferences about hidden weather states based on observable umbrella evidence."
